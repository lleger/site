title: New year, new site
---

I registered this domain somewhere around 2005. I would've been about 15 years old at the time. I remember how excited I was to have my own place on the internet. For a young kid, especially one interested in technology, owning a piece of the internet with your name on it was a pretty big deal.

In the beginning, I blogged with a fair amount of regularity about the subjects that interested me -- technology, politics, philosophy. Having a platform to write openly allowed me to explore my own individual feelings. It allowed me an opportunity to -- sometimes clumsily -- reason out my beliefs on an open stage, which caused me both to form stronger opinions and then also how to defend those opinions. It also forced me to hone my writing, to become better at clearly communicating my ideas, and to explore my own style of prose.

It also provided a great platform for me to begin exploring programming on the web. Having a blog (at that time, built on Wordpress) allowed me to explore such new concepts as HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. The continual hacking proved important for my professional career. It got me my first job, which got me my second, which lead to [my final one][na].

Now, several iterations later, I'm finally [blogging like a hacker][tpw]. Looking at that young kid, muddling around Wordpress without a clue how to use CSS to float one column next to the other, it's an amazing transition to today, when I'm blogging using [Jekyll][j], an amazing Ruby-based static blogging engine. A blog hosted on S3 and presented by Cloudfront -- technology I would've scratched my head at years ago, but which I now use every day. (I plan on doing a write-up on my setup sometime soon, but for now you can view the [repo on Github][gh].)

It's been a great ride so far. Through seven years and many changes, bugs and more changes, this site has been important in shaping who I am today, and I'm very much looking forward to how it, and I, evolve in the future.
