				<p>I went to LSU to study computer engineering, but somewhere along the way ended up with a company. And then another. And then a few more.</p>

				<p>I&rsquo;m an engineer by training, but an entrepreneur by nature. It&rsquo;s my calling. My passion is creating new technologies that enhance the lives of those around me. I&rsquo;m always looking to make things simpler, faster, smaller &mdash; better.</p>

				<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming since I was a kid. I started out in C and C++. In high school, I picked up C# and did started tinkering with hardware. In college, I got my first web development job and learned Perl and then PHP. I landed on Ruby, and haven&rsquo;t looked back.</p>

				<p>I&rsquo;m currently building NewAperio, a new kind of consulting firm that helps people launch businesses. We also help existing businesses optimize their workflow through mobile technology. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun. I&rsquo;m also working on SiftPro, a company that started on a <a href="http://startupbus.com">bus</a>. We want to make twitter a better place for everyone.</p>

				<p>I fell in love with Baton Rouge. The people, the food, the culture &mdash; it&rsquo;s an amazing place. I want to build my future here, but I also want to build the future of this city. There are a lot of really great people here doing amazing things. I think we can make it better.</p>
